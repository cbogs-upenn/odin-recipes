    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is some real white trash food, y'all. It's ground beef mixed with boxed deluxe Mac and Cheese. We like to add a vegetable so that we are eating a vegetable.</p>

        <li>Ground beef, 1 lb.</li>
        <li>Deluxe macaroni and cheese, 2 boxes with sauce packets</li>

        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: Garlic powder, other herbs and spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a suitable quantity of water to a boil in a large pot.</li>
        <li>Steam the broccoli in the microwave according to the package directions.</li>
        <li>Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium-high heat, seasoning it with salt, pepper, and whatever other seasonings you prefer.</li>
        <li>When the beef is browned, add the steamed broccoli and combine.</li>
        <li>When the water boils, add the macaroni and cook until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the macaroni and return to the pot.  Add cheese packets and meat and broccoli mixture. Mix thoroughly and serve.</li>
