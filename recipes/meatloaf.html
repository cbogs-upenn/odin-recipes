    <h2>Description</h2><div id="description">
    <p>This meatloaf is made similarly to how my mom made it.  The main difference between this recipe and most others that I am familiar with is that my mother always used oatmeal in her meatloaf.  I prefer it this way, and it has the additional benefit of making the meatloaf gluten-free!</p>
    <p>You can alter this recipe in many ways by adding ingredients to make your meatloaf more interesting.  Onion, herbs and spices make excellent additions.</p>
